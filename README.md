## Description 
This application allows users to help find pets available for adoption. This is mainly focused on dogs and cats since those are the most common household pets. Users are able to find pets based on specific filters such as age, gender, and animal category (dog or cat).

Our motivation for building this app all stems from our love of animals, specifically dogs. We wanted to provide an easy way to get people to adopt animals from shelters. There are so many pets in shelters and we want all those loving animals to find their fur-ever homes!
